### Development Guidelines

#### Working with the New Architecture

1. **Component Updates**:
   - When modifying map functionality, identify which component needs changes (MapInstance, MapInteractions, ToolManager, etc.)
   - For state changes, use the appropriate custom hook (useMapState, useToolState, useFeatureState)
   - Keep components focused on their single responsibility

2. **Adding New Tools**:
   - Add tool configuration to `src/config/toolConfig.ts`
   - Implement tool logic in `ToolManager.tsx` or create a dedicated tool component
   - Update styling logic in `FeatureStyler.tsx` if needed
   - Add any new utility functions to appropriate files in `src/utils/`
   - Create icon component in `src/icons/` if the tool needs a custom icon

3. **State Management**:
   - Map-related state (view, layers, transitions): Use `useMapState`
   - Tool selection and legends: Use `useToolState`
   - Feature selection and editing: Use `useFeatureState`
   - Complex shared state should be lifted to the closest common ancestor component

4. **Styling**:
   - All feature styling logic is centralized in `FeatureStyler.tsx`
   - Use existing utility functions from `styleUtils.ts` and `colorUtils.ts`
   - For new feature types, add styling functions to `FeatureStyler.tsx`
   - Measure tool uses dedicated styling with custom dark gray dashed lines and distance text labels
   - Text features use 14px Arial font with white stroke (width 3) and black fill for optimal visibility
   - Text scaling and rotation applied through OpenLayers Text style properties for optimal rendering performance

5. **File Operations**:
   - File import/export logic is in `FileManager.tsx`
   - Download functionality is implemented in `MapEditor.tsx` with `downloadBlob` function
   - Support for GeoJSON, KML, and KMZ formats with enhanced format handling
   - KML/KMZ exports include proper styling and feature metadata
   - Improved KML parsing with correct EPSG:4326 projection handling for geographic coordinates
   - The file input element is managed in `MapEditor.tsx` for better control

6. **Keyboard Shortcuts & Clipboard**:
   - Keyboard shortcuts are managed through `useKeyboardShortcuts.ts`
   - Clipboard state is handled in `useFeatureState.ts` with `ClipboardState` interface
   - Copy/paste operations support both cut and copy modes with proper feature tracking
   - Features are pasted at current cursor position with automatic coordinate transformation
   - Undo/redo operations use ol-ext UndoRedo interaction with singleton pattern to prevent re-initialization

7. **Undo/Redo Implementation**:
   - UndoRedo interaction is initialized once in `MapInteractions.tsx` with proper guard patterns
   - All drawing operations are automatically tracked through `autoTrack: true`
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y) trigger undo/redo operations
   - Undo history persists across tool switches due to singleton implementation
   - Uses ol-ext library with proper TypeScript type definitions in `src/types/ol-ext.d.ts`

8. **Multi-Selection Implementation**:
   - Multi-selection functionality is implemented in `MapInteractions.tsx` with configurable modes
   - Supports three multi-selection modes: "shift-click" (default), "always", and "custom"
   - Drag selection allows selecting multiple features within a selection box
   - Multi-feature copy/paste/cut operations work seamlessly with the clipboard system
   - Selection state is managed through callbacks for proper state synchronization
   - Visual feedback provides clear indication of selected features and multi-selection operations

9. **Data Persistence with PGLite**:
   - PGLite database integration for local data storage with PostgreSQL compatibility
   - Map state and feature data persistence through `mapStateUtils.ts`
   - Advanced serialization utilities in `serializationUtils.ts` for complex feature storage
   - Automatic data recovery and restoration capabilities
   - Performance-optimized database operations for real-time applications

10. **Multi-Job/Project Management**:
   - Project-based data isolation with separate PGLite databases for each project
   - Comprehensive CRUD operations through `useMapProjects.ts` hook
   - Project metadata management with timestamps and persistent storage
   - Dynamic database creation and deletion with proper cleanup
   - Cross-tab synchronization using localStorage events
   - Automatic default project initialization on first app load

#### Benefits of the New Architecture
- **Easier debugging** - Issues can be isolated to specific components
- **Better testing** - Each component can be unit tested independently
- **Improved reusability** - Components can be reused in other parts of the application
- **Cleaner code** - Related functionality is grouped together
- **Type safety** - Better TypeScript support with proper interfaces and props

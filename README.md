- **Connection Pooling**: Resource management
- **Compression**: Reduced storage footprint

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Map not loading**: Check network connection and CORS settings
2. **Tools not working**: Verify OpenLayers library loading
3. **Data not saving**: Check browser storage permissions
4. **Import failing**: Validate file format and structure
5. **PDF export slow**: Reduce resolution or page size for faster exports
6. **Icons not displaying**: Verify Google Earth icon files are in public/google_earth_icons/
7. **Search not working**: Check internet connection for Nominatim API access
8. **Merge not working**: Ensure endpoints are within snap tolerance distance
9. **Folders not importing**: Ensure KML has proper `<Folder>` elements or GeoJSON has dsMapTool metadata
10. **Drag-drop not working**: Check that @dnd-kit dependencies are installed

### Performance Issues
1. **Slow rendering**: Reduce number of features or simplify geometries
2. **Memory usage**: Clear cache and restart browser
3. **Network errors**: Check internet connectivity
4. **PDF export timeout**: For large/complex maps, reduce resolution or select smaller area
5. **Split/Merge lag**: Complex LineStrings with many vertices may take longer to process

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support with minor UI differences
- **Mobile**: Limited touch interaction support
